						The aim of our first campaign is to encourage continuous support for the ongoing refugee crisis by
						giving donors the opportunity to feel more involved in the work that they are making possible. We do
						this by allowing donors to sign up for REGULAR email updates on the progress that is being made in
						the areas that their money is being used.
